# Chess Engine

This is a chess engine developed in JavaScript with the goal of achieving a rating of 1000+. The engine uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to evaluate moves and simulate realistic gameplay. The project is designed for ease of development and testing, with plans to add more advanced features and improve performance over time.

## Features

- **Move Generation**: Generates all legal moves from any given board position.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements the minimax algorithm to evaluate potential moves and select the optimal one.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes the minimax algorithm by pruning branches, significantly improving the efficiency and speed of the engine.
- **Board Evaluation**: Basic evaluation function to assess board positions and choose moves.
